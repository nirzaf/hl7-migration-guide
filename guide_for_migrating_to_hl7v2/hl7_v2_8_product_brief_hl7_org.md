### DESCRIPTION

HL7â€™s Version 2.x (V2) messaging standard is the workhorse of electronic data exchange in the clinical domain and arguably the most widely implemented standard for healthcare in the world. This messaging standard allows the exchange of clinical data between systems. It is designed to support a central patient care system as well as a more distributed environment where data resides in departmental systems.

### ALTERNATIVE NAMES

### BENEFITS

### IMPLEMENTATIONS/CASE STUDIES

*   95% of US healthcare organizations use HL7 V2.x

### DEVELOPMENT BACKGROUND

As one of the most widely implemented standards for healthcare information in the world, the Version 2 Messaging Standard was first released in October 1987 as an Application Protocol for Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Environments. Version 2.8, representing the latest update to the Version 2 Standard, was published in 2014.

Due to its widespread use, Version 2 will continue to play an integral part in healthcare messaging, even with the HL7 Version 3 Normative Edition. HL7 is committed to supporting and extending Version 2 in parallel with Version 3, providing continuity for current installations.
