## Major EHR Vendor Migration Resources

Major EHR vendors like Epic, Cerner, Meditech, and Allscripts provide HL7 interfaces for data exchange. However, their specific guidance on migrating to HL7 v2.8 is not always publicly available and is often part of their proprietary documentation for customers.

### Epic

*   **HL7v2 Support:** Epic's open.epic platform indicates support for HL7 v2.5.1 for Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR). While this doesn't explicitly mention v2.8, it shows their engagement with HL7 standards. Specific v2.8 migration guides are likely available to Epic customers through their support channels.
*   **Migration Resources:** Epic provides general EHR migration guides and whitepapers, but these focus on migrating *to* Epic from other EHRs, rather than on upgrading HL7 versions within an Epic environment. These resources can still be valuable for understanding general data migration principles.

### Cerner

*   **HL7 Support:** Cerner's documentation and real-world testing plans mention HL7 transactions and implementation guides, but specific details on v2.8 migration are not readily found in public documents. Their support for HL7 is evident, but version-specific guidance is likely restricted to customers.
*   **Data Migration:** Cerner provides resources and best practices for data migration to their EHR system. These resources can offer insights into data management and migration strategies that are relevant to HL7 version upgrades.

### Meditech

*   **Interoperability Solutions:** Meditech offers interoperability solutions that support various standards, including HL7. Their documentation mentions HL7 in the context of outbound orders and other data exchange scenarios. However, specific v2.8 migration guides are not publicly available.
*   **Data Migration:** Meditech provides resources on data migration to their Expanse platform. These resources can be helpful for understanding data preservation and migration methodologies.

### Allscripts

*   **HL7 Support:** Allscripts' documentation indicates support for HL7 v2.3 in their solutions. While this is an older version, it shows their use of HL7. Information on their support for and migration to v2.8 would be available to their customers.
*   **Integration and APIs:** Allscripts provides developer resources and information on their APIs, which can be relevant for understanding their integration capabilities.

### General Observations

For all major EHR vendors, the most detailed and specific guidance on migrating to HL7 v2.8 will be found in their official documentation, which is typically accessible only to their customers. This is because:

*   **Proprietary Information:** Migration guides and configuration details are considered proprietary information.
*   **Customer-Specific Solutions:** Migration strategies are often tailored to individual customer environments and needs.
*   **Support and Training:** Vendors provide support and training to their customers to ensure successful migrations.

Therefore, organizations using these EHRs should consult their vendor's support portal, account manager, or professional services for specific guidance on HL7 v2.8 migration.
