## HL7 v2.8 Migration: Risk Assessment Template

This template assists in identifying, assessing, and planning mitigation strategies for risks associated with an HL7 v2.8 migration project. It should be used iteratively throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1. Risk Identification

| Risk ID | Risk Category | Description of Risk | Potential Impact (High/Medium/Low) | Likelihood (High/Medium/Low) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-001 | Data Integrity | Data loss or corruption during ETL processes. | High | Medium |
| R-002 | System Availability | Unplanned downtime of critical systems during migration. | High | Medium |
| R-003 | Interoperability | Incompatibilities between new v2.8 interfaces and existing systems. | Medium | Medium |
| R-004 | Performance | Degradation of system performance post-migration. | Medium | Low |
| R-005 | Security | New security vulnerabilities introduced. | High | Low |
| R-006 | User Adoption | Resistance from end-users due to lack of training or poor usability. | Medium | Medium |
| R-007 | Scope Creep | Uncontrolled expansion of project requirements. | Medium | Medium |
| R-008 | Budget | Cost overruns due to unforeseen issues. | Medium | Medium |
| R-009 | Compliance | Failure to meet regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA). | High | Low |
| R-010 | Vendor Dependency | Delays or issues from third-party vendors. | Medium | Low |

### 2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plan

| Risk ID | Impact Score (1-5) | Likelihood Score (1-5) | Risk Score (Impact x Likelihood) | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| R-001 | 5 | 3 | 15 | Implement robust data validation and reconciliation processes; conduct thorough data mapping and transformation testing. | Data Lead | Open |
| R-002 | 5 | 3 | 15 | Develop detailed rollback plan; schedule migration during off-peak hours; ensure redundant systems are in place. | Infrastructure Lead | Open |
| R-003 | 4 | 3 | 12 | Conduct extensive integration testing with all connected systems; involve key stakeholders early in the testing phase. | HL7 Architect | Open |
| R-004 | 3 | 2 | 6 | Conduct performance benchmarking before and after migration; optimize interface configurations. | Technical Lead | Open |
| R-005 | 5 | 2 | 10 | Conduct security audits and penetration testing; implement strong access controls and encryption. | Security Lead | Open |
| R-006 | 3 | 3 | 9 | Develop comprehensive training programs; involve users in UAT; provide clear communication on benefits. | Project Manager | Open |
| R-007 | 3 | 3 | 9 | Establish clear scope definition and change control process; regular stakeholder reviews. | Project Manager | Open |
| R-008 | 3 | 3 | 9 | Allocate contingency budget; closely monitor expenses; regular financial reviews. | Project Manager | Open |
| R-009 | 5 | 2 | 10 | Engage legal/compliance team; ensure all data handling processes meet regulatory standards. | Compliance Officer | Open |
| R-010 | 3 | 2 | 6 | Establish clear SLAs with vendors; identify alternative solutions; maintain strong vendor relationships. | Procurement Lead | Open |

**Risk Score Interpretation:**
*   **High (15-25):** Critical risk, requires immediate attention and significant mitigation efforts.
*   **Medium (6-14):** Moderate risk, requires planned mitigation and regular monitoring.
*   **Low (1-5):** Minor risk, requires monitoring and may be accepted.

### 3. Risk Monitoring and Reporting

*   **Frequency of Review:** (e.g., Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly)
*   **Reporting Mechanism:** (e.g., Project Status Report, Dedicated Risk Register Review)
*   **Key Metrics:** (e.g., Number of open risks, average risk score, number of new risks)

**Note:** This template is a starting point. Customize risk categories, impact/likelihood scales, and mitigation strategies to fit your organization's specific context and risk appetite.
