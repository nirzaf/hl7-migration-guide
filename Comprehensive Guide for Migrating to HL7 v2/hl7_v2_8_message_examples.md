[ INSURANCE (Optional) ]
[ ACC - Accident (Optional) ]
[ UB1 - UB82 Data (Optional) ]
[ UB2 - UB92 Data (Optional) ]
[ PDA - Patient Death and Autopsy (Optional) ]
```

### HL7 v2.8 ADT^A04 Message Structure (Simplified)

```
MSH - Message Header (Required)
SFT - Software Segment (Optional)
[ UAC - User Authentication Credential Segment (Optional) ]
EVN - Event Type (Required)
PID - Patient Identification (Required)
PD1 - Patient Additional Demographic (Optional)
[ ARV - Access Restriction (Optional) ]
[ ROL - Role (Optional) ]
[ NK1 - Next Of Kin / Associated Parties (Optional) ]
PV1 - Patient Visit (Required)
[ PV2 - Patient Visit - Additional Information (Optional) ]
[ ARV - Access Restriction (Optional) ]
[ ROL - Role (Optional) ]
[ DB1 - Disability (Optional) ]
[ OBX - Observation/result (Optional) ]
[ AL1 - Patient Allergy Information (Optional) ]
[ DG1 - Diagnosis (Optional) ]
[ DRG - Diagnosis Related Group (Optional) ]
[ PROCEDURE (Optional) ]
[ GT1 - Guarantor (Optional) ]
[ INSURANCE (Optional) ]
[ ACC - Accident (Optional) ]
[ UB1 - Ub82 (Optional) ]
[ UB2 - Uniform Billing Data (Optional) ]
[ PDA - Patient Death And Autopsy (Optional) ]
```

### Key Differences Highlighted:

*   **UAC Segment:** The `UAC - User Authentication Credential Segment` is introduced in HL7 v2.8 as an optional segment, typically used for conveying user authentication and authorization information.
*   **ARV Segment:** The `ARV - Access Restriction Segment` is introduced in HL7 v2.8 as an optional segment, used to communicate access restriction information related to the patient or visit.
*   **ROL Segment Usage:** While the `ROL - Role` segment exists in both versions, its usage and placement might be refined in v2.8 to provide more specific context (e.g., related to PV1 data, procedures, or insurance).

**Note:** This is a simplified representation. Actual message structures may include various repeating groups, optionality rules, and detailed field definitions that vary between versions. A thorough migration plan requires a detailed analysis of each segment and field relevant to the specific implementation.
